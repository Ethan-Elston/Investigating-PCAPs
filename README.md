# How to Investigate PCAPs Lab

## Objective

To develop proficiency in network traffic analysis by installing and utilizing Wireshark to investigate PCAP files efficiently. This project focuses on identifying potential malicious web shell activity through protocol analysis, filtering techniques, and investigative methodologies.

This project is divided into two parts:
- Part 1: Installing Wireshark and learning basics
- Part 2: Investigating PCAPs

### Skills Learned

- Analyzed PCAP files using Wireshark to investigate network traffic and identify anomalies.
- Developed hands-on experience in inspecting network packets to detect and trace malicious activity.
- Learned to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs) such as unauthorized access via web shells, remote command execution, and network reconnaissance.
- Enhanced understanding of structured network forensic investigations, focusing on attacker behavior and data exfiltration methods.
- Observed attacker techniques, including web shell exploitation, command execution, and port scanning, to improve defensive security measures.

### Tools Used

- Wireshark â€“ Used for capturing, analyzing, and investigating network traffic to identify potential malicious activity.
